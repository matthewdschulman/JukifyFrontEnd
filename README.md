This is the front end for a website called Jukify created during the PennApps 2014 Spring Hackathon. The website will be live soon at jukify.co.

Jukify is a webapp that creates a custom playlist based on which artists your Facebook friends like the most that are attending one of your Facebook events. Jukify is the perfect tool for creating an awesome set for your party. Just specify which genres you want, connect to Facebook, and Jukify does the rest! Other potential applications include the optimization of content recommendations for retail stores and other groups. Jukify pulls information about your friends' likes using the Facebook API and then combines this data with music metadata from the Rdio API to create the ultimate playlist.
